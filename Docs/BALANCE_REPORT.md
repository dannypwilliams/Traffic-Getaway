# Balance Report

## Target

Level 1 target from the production prompt:

- Exit target around 42s.
- Average first crash at least 30s.
- Completion around 40-60% for Starter Compact once sim/live agree.
- Unfair collisions under 5%.
- Average near misses around 3-8.
- Heavy traffic should not dominate the first 25s.

## Interpretation

The sim is now deterministic and traffic-stress clean, but Level 1 is still far outside the intended balance range. The live debug-autoplay matrix is also far outside the sim outcome. Corrected decision telemetry shows actual live moves mostly land on the GameSim-style target. Live-hazard steering improved average terminal time, but all runs still crashed before the exit. Do not tune rewards or density until active traffic lifetime and collision timing are reconciled or intentionally modeled.

## Next

Add collision-frame analysis for the live matrices, decide whether GameSim or live safety selection needs the next parity fix, capture manual human runs, then tune rewards, near-miss rates, and completion after the models are reconciled.
